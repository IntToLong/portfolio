## About This Project

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This site serves as a comprehensive showcase of my skills, experience, and projects as a dedicated Frontend Developer.

The application is built as a clean, responsive single-page application using a modern stack, engaging animations, and a smooth user experience.

### Key Features

* **Dynamic Introduction:** The homepage features a dynamic, self-typing text animation to immediately introduce myself (`react-type-animation`).
* **Skills & Projects:** Clearly organized sections to detail my technical proficiencies and practical work.
* **Animations:** Uses **Motion** for fluid UI transitions and interactive scroll effects.
* **Unique Custom Cursor:** Includes an interactive custom cursor utilizing the CSS property **`mix-blend-mode: exclusion`** to create a modern, high-contrast visual blend with the content underneath.
* **Direct Contact:** Integrated contact form powered by **EmailJS/Browser** to enable direct communication without the need for a separate backend.
